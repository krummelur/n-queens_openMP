# n-queens openMP
An experiment in openMP parallelization that generates solutions to the n-queens problem using openMP parallel for loops, and recursive tasks.

Works for any n (as long as n is less or equal to 11)

Boards are stored as 128-bit integers for easy and fast checking of positions, so in order to run the program, the machine must support 128-bit integers.
